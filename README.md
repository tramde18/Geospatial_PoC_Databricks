# Geospatial PoC - Databricks
This project demonstrates how to build a scalable Geospatial Lakehouse on Databricks using H3 (Uber’s hexagonal spatial index) and Databricks Mosaic. It showcases geospatial data processing, analysis, and visualization workflows for large datasets.

---

#### Features
- H3 integration for spatial indexing.
- Databricks Mosaic for large-scale geospatial operations.
- Sample notebooks for geospatial data analysis.
- Build files for quick setup and deployment.
